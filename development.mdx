description: 'Set up a local environment to test the Blooio API and webhooks'
---

<Info>
  <strong>Prerequisites</strong>
  
  - cURL or an HTTP client (Insomnia/Postman)
  - Optional: Node.js 18+ or Python 3.9+ for examples
  - A public HTTPS endpoint (or a tunneling tool) to receive webhooks. We recommend checking out <a href="https://webhook.site">webhook.site</a> for quick testing.
</Info>

## Environment setup

Set your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export BLOOIO_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Make test requests

Try a simple authenticated request to validate your key:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $BLOOIO_API_KEY" \
  https://edge.blooio.com/v1/api/me
```

Send a message:

```bash
curl -X POST https://edge.blooio.com/v1/api/messages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BLOOIO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: dev-$(uuidgen)" \
  -d '{"to": "+15551234567", "text": "Hello from Blooio (dev)!"}'
```

## Receive webhooks locally

You can test webhooks by running a local server and exposing it with a tunneling tool.

1. Start a local server (Node.js example):

```javascript
// server.js
import express from 'express'

const app = express()
app.use(express.json())

app.post('/webhooks/blooio', (req, res) => {
  console.log('Webhook:', req.headers['x-blooio-event'], req.body)
  res.sendStatus(200)
})

app.listen(3001, () => console.log('Listening on http://localhost:3001'))
```

2. Expose your server:

```bash
ngrok http http://localhost:3001
```

3. Point Blooio to your public URL:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://edge.blooio.com/v1/api/config/webhook \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BLOOIO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"webhook_url":"https://YOUR-NGROK-URL/webhooks/blooio"}'
```

See the full event payloads in [Webhook events](/api-reference/webhooks/events).

## Tips for development

- Use Idempotency-Key during development to avoid duplicates
- Log response bodies and headers when debugging
- Store timestamps (ms) from responses to correlate with webhooks
