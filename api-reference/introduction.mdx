## Overview

The Blooio Messaging API lets you send and receive messages over iMessage, RCS, and SMS. The API automatically selects the most elevated messaging method supported by the target device - iMessage for Apple devices, RCS for supported Android devices, and SMS as a universal fallback. All endpoints are prefixed with `/v1/api` and secured with a Bearer API key.
